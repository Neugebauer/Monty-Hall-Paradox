Monty Hall Paradox
proof that switching doors is the better move
Brian Neugebauer 3/4/2012
Had to write this to prove it to my friend. 

Suppose you're on a game show (like Let's Make A Deal hosted by Monty Hall),
and you're given the choice of three doors:
Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.
You pick a door, say No. 1 [but the door is not opened], and the host,
who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3,
which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?"
Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
